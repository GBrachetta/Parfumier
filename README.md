## Introduction

This app lets users discover perfumes and types of perfumes, learn about them and see what they look like.

It also allows them to register, log in, leave reviews on them and read reviews written by other users.

The app also gives administrators to possibility to add new perfumes, types of perfumes, edit their contents, images and delete them.

I love fragrances and wanted a platform to be able document my perfume collection and offer my reviews on different fragrances.

I developed Parfumier not just to facilitate this, but also to share my passion with others, connect with like-minded individuals and encourage people to explore the world of perfumes.

Please send me a message if you would like to be an administrator and so be able to enter, edit and deal with perfumes.

If you are a visitor, please log in and share your comments on the perfumes in the databse.

The live version of Parfumier can be found **[here](https://parfumier.herokuapp.com/)**

## UX

### What is the purpose of the app

The ultimate goal of Parfumier is to encourage people to discover new perfumes beyond their 'go to' bottles. The app informs them about different fragrances and guides them via descriptions, preview images and reviews written by other users.

### Who is this website for

This website is intended for all fragrance lovers, people curious about perfumes, or people wishing to exchange comments, reviews and experiences around perfumes.

### Who are the primary target groups

The website is aimed at anyone, from teenagers to adults, with an interest in perfumes. It is of particular value to those looking to try a new perfume and be informed before making a purchase.

### What is it that they want to achieve

Users will either want to share their experiences of the perfumes they've tried, or discover a new perfume they have not tried before, guided by accessible information and reviews.

### How is my project the best way to help them achieve those things

The app provides a library of different perfumes and perfume types and includes images that provide a preview of what the perfume bottles look like.

The app features information on the different types of fragrances and any new perfume added is categorised by its type.

Any visitor to the site is able to freely view all information related to the perfumes including reviews left by other users.

Registered users will be authorised to add reviews or comments on the documents and edit their posts.

Registered users can also edit all information related to their account, including their profile picture, and request a password reset.

Administrators are able to update the database by adding perfumes or fragrance types, editing information, or deleting entries. It is worth mentioning that the only limitation admins have is deleting documents not created by themselves, i.e. admins can edit types or perfumes, but won't be able to delete a record created by another admin.

To make all interaction as clear as possible, buttons are available only when they are permitted to the privileges of a registered user or admin.

Basic buttons are still visible in all instances, but attempting to interact with some of the functions will redirect users to the route requiring them either to log in or register.

No anonymous writing to the database is permitted by the app.

### How do users achieve each of the following goals

After users log in, they can edit their account, add reviews, edit them, delete them and even delete their account.

Admins can add perfumes, types, and edit them.

Admins can also add or change perfume or type pictures.

Unregistered visitors can see all information in the database.

Admins can delete perfumes only if they are the creators of the record. They can still edit their content.

Users and admins can request a password reset link to be sent to their email account.

Users and admins can upload an avatar or picture, and change it at any time.

## Design Choices

### General

Like good perfumes, I decided to leave a lot to the suggestion of imagination.
That's why I chose for an airy design, with predominance of white and empty space, pastel colours and soft curves.
All what's in between is to be filled in by memories and evocations produced by the senses.

### Buttons

I chose to have well rounded buttons for a soft, visually pleasing impact.
All buttons use custom colours from the palette to avoid having them popping over the clean and airy general design.

### Colors

The colors chosen for the app are all soft shades of pastel colors allowing users to make a visual connection with the world of perfumes: flowers, herbs, spices and woods.

For the main headings I chose a hue of purple which connects to lavender.

![Color Palette](wireframes/palette.png)

### Fonts

Only two font families have been used in this app:

- Alex Brush: for the titles and the navbar brand.
  I chose this cursive font to transmit a feeling of craftmanship which is related to the world of perfume making.
- Montserrat: for all the remaining texts, for its excellent legibility specially on small screens, and for it's timeless elegance.
  Additionally these two fonts complement each other, contrast well and they both transmit the balance between elegance and modernity I want to transmit in the app.

### Bootstrap

I chose to use a custom version of Bootstrap's CSS framework, and as such it is minified and loaded from my static folder rather than from a CDN.

    <b><a href="#table-of-contents">↥ Back To Top</a></b>
</div>

## Wireframes

> **Note**:The app evolved and several improvements were put in place through development.
>
> The wireframes served as guidelines but some details such as positioning, pagination for types, placement of avatars, images and buttons and other refinements diverge from the original wireframes on the current state of the application.
>
> Since there's virtually little to no difference between tablet view and desktop view besides the navbar collapsing on smaller tablets, wireframes for them have been omitted

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Login

Users can create an account and log in.
This gives registered users the possibility to add reviews to perfumes, edit them and delete them.

#### Account managment

- Users can edit their account and change their information.
- Users can upload a picture or avatar which will represent their interaction with the app. The picture can also be changed at any point.
- Users have the possibility to delete their account.
- Users can request a password reset in case they forget their password.

#### Perfumes & Types

- Admins are able to create, edit and delete both perfumes and perfume types.
- Admins can upload and change a picture for the above perfumes.
- All users and unregistered visitors can browse and search the full database and access all perfumes and reviews.

#### Admins

- Admins have access to functionalities reserved only to them, such as
  - Creating and editing a perfume or type.
  - Deleting a perfume or type that they themselves have posted.

#### Images

All images interacting with the database are dynamically stored in Cloudinary.com. They are given a reduced size to minimise loading times and the app only needs to render a 'thumbnail' of the full size image stored remotely.
Additionally, in the routes the default 'http' protocol gets replaced by 'https' so images get served securely.

Admins can upload perfume photos using Cloudinary. In case a photo is not provided during the creation of the perfume, a default generic picture is saved to the database.

The method used is described below:

```python
if form.validate_on_submit():
    if form.picture.data:
        picture_uploaded = upload(form.picture.data)
        # <cloudinary here>
        picture_link = picture.replace("http", "https")
        mongo.db.perfumes.insert(
            {
                # <other fields>
                "picture": picture_link,
            }
        )
    else:
        mongo.db.perfumes.insert(
            {
                # <other fields>
                "picture": (
                    "https://res.cloudinary.com/gbrachetta/"
                    "image/upload/v1590013198/generic.jpg"
                ),
            }
        )
```

The same method applies to user and type pictures.

#### Custom Validator for types

While it was an easy task to put a validator in place for the user (since it uses flask_login to identify it) it was a bit more complicated to check for existing perfume types when the admin wants to edit it.
For that purpose a hidden field was included in the editReview form and in the route it is assigned the current type in the database.
Thanks to this method, seamless to the user, the custom validator can check the data from the form against it and act the same way put in place in the custom validator for the username and email.

#### Filters & Search

I used the following method to index my collections and allow users to perform searches on the indexed fields:

```python
@perfumes.route("/search")
def search():
    page = request.args.get(get_page_parameter(), type=int, default=1)
    page_count = 8
    types = mongo.db.types.find().sort("type_name")
    mongo.db.perfumes.create_index(
        [("name", "text"), ("brand", "text"), ("perfume_type", "text")]
    ) # This creates the indexes for the three mentioned fields, allowing users to search the collection
    db_query = request.args["db_query"]
    # If no text is entered, returns all the perfumes.
    if db_query == "":
        return redirect(url_for("perfumes.all_perfumes"))
    # I then use the aggregate method to render the search results including
    # the necessary fields from other collections, such as the avatar,
    # and sort that aggregate by name.
    results = mongo.db.perfumes.aggregate(
        [
            {"$match": {"$text": {"$search": db_query}}}, # search based on the request
            {
                "$lookup": {...} # etc
            },
            {"$unwind": "$creator"},
            {
                "$project": {...} # etc
            },
            {"$sort": {"perfumeName": 1}},
            {"$skip": (page - 1) * page_count}, # pagination
            {"$limit": page_count},
        ]
    )
    count = mongo.db.perfumes.aggregate(
        [
            {"$match": {"$text": {"$search": db_query}}}, # same query as above
            {
                "$lookup": {...} # etc
            },
        ] # uses the variable from the request to count the total records returned
    )
    total_perfumes = len(list(count)) # cursor gets extinguished after use, so this method in place for the count of records returned
    pagination = Pagination(
        per_page=8, # items to be accounted for per page
        page=page, # passes current page
        total=total_perfumes, # total amount of perfumes
        record_name="perfumes", # variable to display on the info
        bs_version=4, # the CSS framework, in this case Bootstrap 4
        alignment="center", # alignment of the pagination buttons
        display_msg="Displaying <b>{start} - {end}</b>\
             {record_name} of <b>{total}</b>", # The message displayed on the info
    )
    return render_template(
        "pages/perfumes.html",
        perfumes=results, # passes the perfumes returned by the query
        types=types, # passes the types in order to populate the select options on the main page
        title=f"Search: {db_query}", # passes the title as an f string
        query=db_query, # passes the query in order to display it in the title
        pagination=pagination, # passes the pagination configuration
    )
```

#### Types Cards

Admins are prompted to upload an image when they create a type. When they do so, that image bacomes the background of the type card.

The image is reduced automatically in size on cloudinary and given an opacity of 20% by the method in the route, so regardless of the size of the image uploaded it doesn't have much impact on the performance of the app.

If no image is selected, a default image is assigned to the databse so there won't be a card without a background.

#### Onerror for images

In the event an image couldn't be found on Cloudinary (albeit a very unlikely possibility) I put in place a defensive JavaScript onerror function which returns a fallback image.

This would still throw a console error, but it will avoid displaying a broken image icon and the user would still be able to have visual feedback seeing a generic avatar or a generic perfume bottle.

### Future Goals

Some of the features I would like to implement in the future are:

- Request administrator status during the registration.
- Put in place personal collections of perfumes. The perfumes collection includes a currently unused boolean field to allow for this in a feature release.
- Use JavaScript to deal with all the forms.

## Information Architecture

### Models

Perfumes Collection

```json
"perfumes": {
    "_id": "<ObjectId>",
    "author": "<string>",
    "brand": "<string>",
    "name": "<string>",
    "perfume_type": "<string>",
    "descritpion": "<text field>",
    "date_updated": "<date>",
    "public": "<boolean>",
    "picture": "<string>",
    "reviews": {
        "_id": "<ObjectId>",
        "review_content": "<text field>",
        "reviewer": "<string>",
        "date_reviewed": "<date>",
        "reviewer_picture": "<string>"
    }
}
```

Users collection

```json
"users": {
    "_id": "<ObjectId>",
    "username": "<string>",
    "first_name": "<string>",
    "last_name": "<string>",
    "email": "<string>",
    "password": "<string>",
    "is_admin": "<boolean>",
    "avatar": "<string>"
}
```

Types collection

```json
"types": {
    "_id": "<ObjectId>",
    "type_name": "<string>",
    "description": "<text field>",
    "type_picture": "<string>",
    "author": "<string>"
}
```

### Database Aggregation

MongoDB is a non-relational database but I still decided to have three different collections and find ways to combine data in the same cursor from them by using aggregation, such as in the colde below:

``` python
cur = mongo.db.perfumes.aggregate(
    [
        {
            "$lookup": {
                "from": "users",
                "localField": "author",
                "foreignField": "username",
                "as": "creator",
            }
        },
        {"$unwind": "$creator"},
        {
            "$project": {
                "_id": "$_id",
                "perfumeName": "$name",
                "perfumeBrand": "$brand",
                "perfumeDescription": "$description",
                "date_updated": "$date_updated",
                "perfumePicture": "$picture",
                "isPublic": "$public",
                "perfumeType": "$perfume_type",
                "username": "$creator.username",
                "firstName": "$creator.first_name",
                "lastName": "$creator.last_name",
                "profilePicture": "$creator.avatar",
            }
        },
        {"$match": {"_id": ObjectId(perfume_id)}},
    ]
)
```

### Data Storage

No data is stored in the file system.

Since Heroku has an ephemeral file system I decided to incorporate Cloudinary for the images, which was at the beginning of the development the only process still writing to it.

### About Cloudinary

The app originally saved media files to the file system, but that caused some issues:

- The local and remote file systems are different spaces, so pictures uploaded while on development didn't exist remotely (and vice-versa).
- Heroku's file system is ephemeral, meaning that it is rebuilt on each deployment. That causes that all pictures uploaded at a certain point get destroyed on subsequent deploys, making the media file practically unmanageable.

With this in mind I decided saving photos in a cloud-based solution reachable both locally and remotely.
The options I considered were Imgur and Cloudinary, and chose the latter due to its set of features and ease of use and setup.

All images have a `loading="lazy"` attribute with specified dimensions so they are only loaded when required, regardless of how small they are after being converted on Cloudinary.

The images on the about page were minified on [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/).

### About CKEditor

CKEDitor version 4 was my choice in order to give admins and users the possibility to enter text in Rich Text Format.
The required script renders all text area fields as WYSIWYG editors, giving users and admins the possibility to use rich text features when adding text, such as back, italics, lists and numbered lists.
JQuery was used to retrieve the html elements in order to pre-populate the contents of the forms in the edit reviews form, since those elements live in a modal.
CKEditor's scripts only load on the pages where they are required, avoiding unnecessary loading time on other pages.

### About Flask-paginate

After having in place a standard pagination system, I decided to migrate it to [flask-paginate](https://github.com/lixxu/flask-paginate) which gave me a lot more options for the purposes of my app.

Flask-paginate takes in several paramaters in order to display as required. The documentation is quite limited but after digging into the code of the dependency I found what I needed to and managed to dysplay it and style it as I wanted it to.

```python
pagination = Pagination(
    per_page=8, # Indicates how many records per page for the 'info' to display the proper count
    page=page, # Indicates  how to displate the page number and which one is the default
    total=total_perfumes, # Passes the total amount of perfumes
    record_name="perfumes", # the item to be displayed in the info label of the pagination
    bs_version=4, # Specifies which CSS framework, in this case Bootstrap 4
    alignment="center", # Alignment of the navigation
    display_msg="Displaying <b>{start} - {end}</b>{record_name} of <b>{total}</b>", # My custom message to display in the info
)
```

Pagination now correctly displays both on perfumes and types pages, also when a search is performed.

</div>

## Testing

### Tests performed

- Navigation never breaks:
  - Regardless of what the user attempts to do, there's never the need to click the 'back' button to return to a page. Either clicking a button, or a menu item would bring the user to their required spot in the app.
- Forms don't break:
  - Validators in the forms are clear and explain what to do or not to do with them.
- Custom validators work:
  - Usernames cannot contain spaces or characters other than letters, numbers and underscores, even when updating the account.
  - Reviews cannot be empty.
  - Passwords must contain at least a letter, a number and a special character.
- Not uploading a picture for an user or for a perfume defaults to a standard predetermined picture.
- Non-admin users don't have access to functionalities reserved to admins, such as the creation or deletion of a perfume or a type of perfume.
- Request to reset the password has been tested in all possible scenarios and the tests passed all of them.
- Deleting a document, or an object in an array of objects, always deletes the proper one indentified by its ObjectId.
- Users cannot delete or edit documents others than the ones created by them.
- Admins cannot click the delete button for perfumes not created by them.
- Error pages respond correctly to all possible errors. To test this, errors have been purposedly provoqued in order to invoque the above pages.
- Visiting non-existing endpoints correctly returns the 404.html template, with access to all navigation.
- Regardless of the size of the image uploaded, cloudinary deals with it and resizes it to the predetermined dimensions.
- Attempting to write a review without being logged in makes a modal open letting the user know that such operation isn't permitted.

### Validators and linters

The following validators and linters were used either remotely or with their plugins for Visual Studio Code:

- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/)
- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
- [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/)
- [BLACK](https://pypi.org/project/black/)

## Deployment

### Local Development

This project can be ran locally by following the following steps:

1. Visit this [Repository link](https://github.com/GBrachetta/Parfumier) and click on the Clone or Download button to copy the link provided.

    ![clone](wireframes/clone.png)

2. In your IDE, open a Terminal window and change to the directory where you want to clone this project and type:

    `Git clone "your copied link"`

    After pressing Enter the project will be created and cloned locally.

    (Alternatively you can download the zipped file, decompress it and use your IDE of choice to access it.)

3. Create a free account on [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/) and reproduce the 3 collections as described [here](#information-architecture).
4. Create a free account on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).
5. Make sure you either have access to your email server settings and credentials or to your cloud based email, such as [Gmail](https://accounts.google.com/b/0/AddMailService).
6. Install [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). This app was developed on a Mac, and on MacOS you can install pipenv by typing `brew pipenv` (provided you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed).
7. Create a virtual enviroment by typing

   `pipenv shell`

8. Install all dependencies present in pipfile by executing

   `pipenv install`

9. Create a series of enviroment variables following the below criteria

   ```json
      {
      "MONGO_URI": "Your mongodb connection string",
      "SECRET_KEY": "Your secret key",
      "MAIL_USERNAME": "Your email username",
      "MAIL_PASSWORD": "Your email password",
      "CLOUDINARY_URL": "Your Cloudinary account url"
      }
   ```

   `Be aware that you will need to adapt line 85 of utils.py to match your own email server!`

10. You will then be able to run the app locally by typing either `python app.py` or `flask run`.
    Alternatively you can force debbug mode by typing this set of commands (they can be all in the same line)

    `FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run`

    This will force debbug mode on and will let you see all error messages thanks to [Wekzeug](https://pypi.org/project/Werkzeug/), a WSGI web application library that makes tracking errors much easier and more comprehensively.

### Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) was chosen as the deployment platform for this project.
The steps to deploy the local app to Heroku were as follow:

1. In Heroku, created an app. The app must have a unique name.
2. Linked that app to the GitHub repository by going to the "Deploy" tab in the main app menu.
3. Selected a branch to deploy automatically (alternatively one could opt to deploy manually instead).
4. In the Settings tab, added the corresponding Config Variables as present in my local development:

   ```none
      CLOUDINARY_URL (Allowing to upload pictures to my Cloudinary account)
      MAIL_PASSWORD (Used by python mail to connect to my smtp server to deal with sending emails)
      MAIL_USERNAME (Same as above)
      MONGO_URI (Connecting string to my MongoDB)
      SECRET_KEY
   ```

5. I used [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to deal with my virtual enviroment, which creates a pipfile for the dependencies needed for the app and a pipfile.lock to deal with versioning of these dependencies.
6. This pipfile renders the file 'requirements.txt' unnecessary, so it was not included in the project.
7. I installed the dependency [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) which is a Python WSGI HTTP Server.
8. I also created a "Procfile", needed by Heroku in order to know how to run the app and instructed it to run my app using the Gunicorn server in it.
9. When deploying, Heroku reads the pipfiles to install the dependencies, reads the Procfile and the Config Variables inserted above.
10. After that process, the app was live and running remotely in Heroku's servers.

### Version Control

During the development I used [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for version control.

By this I was able to isolate feature in different branches and integrated them as soon as they were finished and fully tested.

As soon as I considered that a feature was finished I then merged its branch to the develop branch. I then deleted stale branches once they were sufficiently tested and approved for release.

When a group of features made a release worthwhile I then merged the develop branch to the master branch.

Additionaly, and for testing purposes, I often also deployed feature branches in order to double-check that the app was responsive remotely.

Over 40 branches were using during the development of this app, to ensure isolated enviroments for each of them without interfering with already functioning features.

To deal with these features i used [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and put in place a [project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards), which helped me organise my workflow and have a clear overview of where in the process of my development I was.
